## Lesson 8. Integrating with Redis

Hi! Long time I haven't posted lessons. Sorry for that:\) Today we are integrating our ~~highload~~ bot with lighting fast database called [Redis](https://redis.io). I am using it for data that needs quick access.

### Library

For driver I chose [Lettuce](https://lettuce.io) because of its popularity and good documentation. You can download it [here](https://lettuce.io/core/release/download/) or install with Maven:

```text
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.lettuce</groupId>
    <artifactId>lettuce-core</artifactId>
    <version>Latest</version>
</dependency>
```

### Establish connection

Then, you need to connect to Redis:

```java
RedisClient redisClient;
StatefulRedisConnection<String, String> redisConnection;
RedisCommands<String, String> syncCommands;

redisClient = RedisClient.create("redis://localhost:6379/0"); // Format: redis://ip:post/dbNumber
redisConnection = redisClient.connect();
syncCommands = this.redisConnection.sync();
```

### Connection established

And thats all! Now you can execute commands like that:

```java
syncCommands.get("key");
syncCommands.set("key", "value");
syncCommands.lrange("key", 0, -1);
```

Also, don't forget to close connection with Redis when you done your work:

```java
redisConnection.close();
redisClient.shutdown();
```

Very short lesson, but I think useful :D Thanks for your time, hope to see you soon!
